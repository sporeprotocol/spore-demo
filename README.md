![](https://github.com/ahonn/spore-demo/assets/9718515/b478387b-3dfa-49e5-89db-509467962744)

A Spore Protocol Demo based on Next.js + React + [Spore SDK](https://github.com/sporeprotocol/spore-sdk), which implements basic functionalities such as
the creation and transfer of clusters, as well as minting, transferring, and melting of spores.

## Technology Stack

- **Next.js** - A JavaScript framework created by Vercel..
- **React** - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Mantine** - A Fully Featured React components library.
- **Spore Graphql Layer** - A GraphQL Layer for query Spore/Cluster data.
- **Spore SDK** - A SDK for interacting with the Spore Protocol.

## Supported Wallets

This project currently supports the following wallets:

- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io) - A crypto wallet & gateway to blockchain apps.
- ~~[JoyID](https://joy.id) - Universal Account Protocol for Web3 Mass-adoption.~~ (We temporarily disable JoyID in the demo to avoid confusion. It will be re-added when we can fully support JoyID. See [issue#69](https://github.com/sporeprotocol/spore-demo/issues/69))

> This project integrates MetaMask ~~and JoyID~~ through the use of [Omnilock](https://blog.cryptape.com/omnilock-a-universal-lock-that-powers-interoperability-1) for now.
